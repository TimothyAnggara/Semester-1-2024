	- Preparing if a scenario goes awry
		- Preparing what happens if you got sick on the day of the holiday
- Threat / Opportunity Paradox
	- Crisis can also be used to rethink on old sturctures
		- Represents opportunities for new developments
	- This paradox is difficult for a leader because to navigate the crisis / threat, you have to also be able to predict what the opportunity is
		- Leader should be able to look into the near and the far term 
	- A consequence of this paradox is 'groupthink'
